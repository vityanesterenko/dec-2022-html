    Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956)[40] is a man from Springfield. He is the spouse of Marge Simpson and father of
    Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be 239 pounds)[41], lazy, and often ignorant to the
    world around him. Although he has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those he
    cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't.

    <li>Marge, I have always carried myself with a certain quiet dignity. Tonight, you robbed me of it.</li>
    <li>Now, you lost someone special and it hurt. I never lost anyone special to me. Everyone special to me is under
        this roof. It's true. Now, you'll have lots of special people in your life</li>
    <li>There's probably a place they hang out and the food is good, and guys like me are serving drinks.</li>

    Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson (born Feburary 23 or April 1, 1980)[7]is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood,
    disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He is the only son of
    Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after
    discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical Hit",
    "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the Simpson
    Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.

    <li>I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks and blows</li>
    <li>Unlike with Homer and Lisa, Bart never goes out of his way to prank Marge, and feels very guilty whenever he
        upsets or hurts her in any way</li>
    <li>While being disliked by most adults, Bart is rather popular with other kids and has very many friends at his
        school</li>
